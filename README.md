# Early-Detection-of-DR-from-digital-retinal-fundus-Images.
To identify retinal features for DR disease diagnosis and early detection using Machine Learning and Ensemble Classification method, called, ML-BEC is designed.Back propagation neural network and one rule classifier techniques are used for the classifying the images as diabetic or non- diabetic.
